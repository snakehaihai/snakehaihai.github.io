I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2013 and 2019, respectively, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research focuses on robotics perception and navigation. Currently, I am a postdoctoral senior research fellow at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

I have contributed over 80 papers to leading journals such as TRO, IJRR, ISPRS, TIE, RAL, and prestigious conferences including ICRA, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, and IROS. I serve as an associate editor for the Unmanned Systems Journal and as a guest editor for the Electronics Special Issue on Advanced Technologies of Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
