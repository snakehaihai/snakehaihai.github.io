I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2013 and 2019, respectively, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research focuses on robotics perception and navigation. Currently, I am a senior research fellow at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research interest lies in robotics, with a focus on SLAM, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation in challenging environments such as mines and dynamic human-robot spaces, aiming to advance adaptive and collaborative robotic systems.

I have authored over 140 papers in top-tier journals such as **T-RO**, **IJRR**, **ISPRS**, **T-IE**, and **RAL**, and at leading conferences including **ICRA**, **CVPR**, **ICCV**, **NeurIPS**, and **IROS**. My work has been cited over **2,100 times**. I actively serve as a reviewer for all major robotics and vision venues, receiving **Outstanding Reviewer Awards** from **ICRA** and **CVPR**, and the **Best Editorial Award** for community service. I am an **Associate Editor** for *WSPC Unmanned Systems* and a **Guest Editor** for *MDPI Electronics* (Special Issue: *Advanced Technologies of Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles*).

Throughout my academic journey and professional career, I have always been passionate about mentoring and guiding others. I have had the privilege of mentoring or co-supervising over 120 undergraduate Design and Innovation project students, more than 25 undergraduate Final Year Project students, 16 Master’s students, and nine doctoral students. Beyond one-on-one mentorship, I have shared my expertise through more than five seminar talks, reaching a combined audience of over 5,000 participants, both online and in person. Currently, I am seeking an academic position where I can further contribute to education, innovation, and research in the field.
