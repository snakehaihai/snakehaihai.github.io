I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2013 and 2019, respectively, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research focuses on robotics perception and navigation. Currently, I am a senior research fellow at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

I have authored over 80 papers in top-tier journals such as TRO, IJRR, ISPRS, TIE, and RAL, as well as at prestigious conferences like ICRA, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, and IROS. I also actively contribute as a reviewer for all these journals and conferences. I`ve been cited more than 1400 times as a robotics researcher. Additionally, I serve as an associate editor for the WSPC Unmanned Systems Journal and a guest editor for MDPI the Electronics Journal special issue on Advanced Technologies of Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles.

Throughout my academic journey and professional career, I have always been passionate about mentoring and guiding others. I have had the privilege of mentoring or co-supervising over 120 undergraduate Design and Innovation project students, more than 25 undergraduate Final Year Project students, 16 Masterâ€™s students, and nine doctoral students. Beyond one-on-one mentorship, I have shared my expertise through more than five seminar talks, reaching a combined audience of over 5,000 participants, both online and in person. Currently, I am seeking an academic position where I can further contribute to education, innovation, and research in the field.
