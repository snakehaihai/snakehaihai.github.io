I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2013 and 2019, respectively, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research focuses on robotics perception and navigation. Currently, I am a postdoctoral senior research fellow at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

I have contributed over 80 papers to leading journals such as TRO, IJRR, ISPRS, TIE, RAL, and prestigious conferences including ICRA, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, and IROS. I serve as an associate editor for the Unmanned Systems Journal and as a guest editor for the Electronics Special Issue on Advanced Technologies of Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles.

In terms of achievements, I secured second place in the academic track of the 2021 Hilti SLAM Challenge, third place in the visual-inertial track of the 2023 ICCV SLAM Challenge, and was honored with the IROS 2023 Best Entertainment and Amusement Paper Award. Additionally, I received the Outstanding Reviewer Award at ICRA 2024.

I have also been actively involved in organizing events such as the CARIC UAV Swarm Challenge and Workshop at CDC 2023, the UG2 Anti-drone Challenge at CVPR 2024, and the second CARIC UAV Swarm Challenge at IROS 2024.
