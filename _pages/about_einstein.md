I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2013 and 2019, respectively, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research focuses on robotics perception and navigation. I am currently a postdoctoral senior research fellow at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My primary research interests lie in robotics and perception systems. I have authored over 80 papers in prestigious journals such as TRO, IJRR, TIE, RAL, and conferences including ICRA, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, and IROS. Additionally, I serve as an associate editor for the Unmanned Systems Journal and as a guest editor for the Electronics special issue on Advanced Technologies of Navigation for Intelligent Vehicles.
