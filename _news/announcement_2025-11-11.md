📝 I have been appointed as an **Associate Editor** of **IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE)**.  
I will be handling submissions in **robotics**, **autonomous and multi-robot systems**, **SLAM/localization**, and **human-centered automation / HRI**.  
Looking forward to serving the community and supporting high-quality work in these areas.
