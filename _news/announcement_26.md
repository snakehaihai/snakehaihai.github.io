🎉 Our paper **“SplatSSC: Decoupled Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Semantic Scene Completion”** has been **accepted to AAAI 2026**.
This work targets large-scale 3D scene completion from sparse/range views, and shows how separating depth guidance from semantic splatting improves robustness and efficiency.
Congrats to all co-authors! 👏
